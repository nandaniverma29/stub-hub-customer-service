              <strong>Q1: How do I talk to a live human at Stubhub?</strong>
              <p>Keep pressing 0.</p>
          
              <strong>Q2: Does Stubhub offer 24 hour customer service?</strong>
              <p>Not at this number; hours here are Mon-Fri 9am–8:30pm, Sat 9am–7pm, Sun 9am–6pm EST.</p>
          
              <strong>Q3: How long will I wait on hold?</strong>

            <h2>How do I get through the phone menu to a live person?</h2>
            <p>GetHuman researchers routinely call this Stubhub phone number to document the phone system.</p>
            <p>Here is our latest tip for weaving through the phone menu to get to a real person the fastest: Keep pressing</p>

            <h2>What are the hours and when should I call?</h2>
            <p>Stubhub operates the call center for this 800-653-8000 phone number Mon-Fri 9am-830pm, Sat 9am-7pm, Sun 9am-6pm ET. The short answer is that you should call on a Friday. This observation and the following section are based on analysis of a sample set of 22,773 calls made in the last 90 days using our free, web-based phone (see above).</p>
            <p>  <strong>An important note: busy times vs hold times vs best time to call</strong></p>
            <p>When we refer to busy or less busy times, we are talking about the volume of calls. The busiest times are when the most people are calling this Stubhub phone number (least busy times have fewer people calling). This high call volume does not necessarily mean that you will have a long hold time when you call. Companies like Stubhub staff their call centers differently based on the time of day and day of the week, so you may experience a shorter wait on hold at the busiest of times. When we refer to the best time to call, we are referring to the optimal combination of lower call volume and shorter wait times.</p>

            <p><b>The least busy time to call</b></p>
            <p>The least busy day to call Stubhub is Friday. The most busy day to call is Tuesday. Again, this is based on a sample of 22,773 calls made with our AI-powered, web-based phone in the last 90 days.</p>
            <p><b>The shortest wait on hold</b></p>
            <p>We measured the shortest hold times to be on Wednesday. The longest wait in the queue on average occurs on Thursday.</p>
            <p><b>The best time to call Stubhub</b></p>
            <p>In summation, the best day to call Stubhub is Friday. This is not the day with the shortest wait on hold in the phone system, but we still recommend it for its ideal combination of low call volume and short hold times. Plus we believe that Stubhub staffs the call center well on Friday.</p>

            <h5>Best Practices for Calling Stubhub Customer Service</h5>
            <p>Here are some of our best tips for helping to ensure that your call to Stubhub customer service goes smoothly:</p>
            <p>Make sure you are calling the right number. Stubhub has different numbers in the countries in which it operates. In addition, it has a separate TDD number for people who are deaf or hearing impaired, as well as a dedicated line for people who have purchased tickets to "arts" events, including the ballet and the symphony.</p>
            <p>Before calling, make sure that you have any necessary information in front of you. This information may include ticket confirmation numbers, dates and times of events, billing statements from your credit card company or any correspondence between you and Stubhub that is relevant to your case.</p>
            <p>Have pen and paper handy so you can take notes during your call. You may need to record confirmation or cancellation numbers or take down the name of the representative who assists you.</p>

            <h5>How do Consumers Feel About Calling Stubhub Customer Service?</h5>
            <p>Stubhub has historically had customer relations problems, primarily due to the company adding additional fees to ticket prices that were not always obvious at the beginning of the purchase process.</p>
            <p>Another issue is that since Stubhub is a third-party business that does not actually own the venues it sells tickets for, the company has limited power when it comes to addressing problems with a specific venue.</p>
            <h5>What Kind of Issues can Stubhub Customer Service Representative Resolve?</h5>
            <p>Stubhub customer service representatives can resolve a range of issues, including questions about tickets and ticket delivery, issues surrounding credit card charges and ticket pricing, and the possibility that a ticket was issued for the wrong class of seating.</p>
            <p>Customer support agents can also, when possible, assist with ticket changes and refunds.</p>

            <h2>What Can't Be Resolved With a Call to Stubhub Customer Service?</h2>
            <p>Venues set their own policies on some issues, such as seating and age-restrictions: Stubhub isn't able to intervene if a customer purchases tickets to a show without understanding these policies. In many cases, tickets are non-refundable and Stubhub is not authorized to initiate refunds to purchasers.</p>
            <p>Individuals who purchase tickets issued by Stubhub through a third party, such as a "scalper" or someone who sells tickets on eBay or Facebook, often have no protection against fraud. Stubhub is not obligated to assist individuals who purchase a ticket through an unauthorized seller.</p>

            <h5>What Should You Do If You Have an Unsuccessful Call with Stubhub?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>If you've tried resolving an issue or getting an answer to a question by calling Stubhub and yet hung up the phone feeling dissatisfied, don't give up. You may still have options.</li>
                <li>First, review any notes that you took during your original call. If you don't have any notes, try and recall what happened during your conversation and write it down. This information can be very helpful if you have to escalate your case.</li>
                <li>Next, call Stubhub back. The next representative you speak to may be better able to assist you.</li>
                <li>If a second call does not resolve your problem, consider getting in touch with Stubhub through a different method. If you have already purchased your ticket, log into your account online and request a live chat. Other options include getting in touch via email or through social media. All of these options have the advantage of providing you with a written transcript of your conversation.</li>
                <li>If Stubhub remains unresponsive, Try sending a letter through postal mail. Be sure to request tracking and delivery confirmation. This is not a fast option, but it does show Stubhub that you are serious about this issue and your letter may end up in the hands of somebody who will be able to take the time to read it and take effective action on your case.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>More Stubhub Customer Service Contacts</h2>
            <p>There are of course other ways to contact Stubhub customer service besides the phone. Below we list the best ones, by medium.</p>
            <p><strong>Stubhub Customer Service Live Chat</strong></p>
            <p>help.Stubhub.com - Fan Support <br>
                Use this link to connect with customer service via chat</p>
                <p>If phone-based customer service is not available, or the wait times are long, many people prefer chat as a next-best option. Some even prefer it to calling on the phone. Luckily, Stubhub provides this option.</p>

                <p><strong>Stubhub Customer Email Addresses</strong></p>
                    <p>customer_support@Stubhub.com - Customer Service <br>
                        Customer service email address
                    </p>

                    <p>Corresponding with a customer service department by email may not be your first choice, especially if your issue is urgent or time-sensitive. But email is a nearly ubiquitous form of communication, and Stubhub will reply our your email.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stubhub Customer Service on X (formerly Twitter)</strong></p>
                    <p>@TMFanSupport - Customer Service <br>
                        Customer service twitter feed
                    </p>
                    <p>Stubhub, like many companies, provides customer service on the X platform (formerly Twitter). While it rarely entails live dialogue with a customer service rep, this channel can yield rapid response times and can be a useful option if you have an X/Twitter account.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stubhub Customer Help Desk / Web Support</strong></p>
                    <p>Stubhub.com - Customer Service <br>
                        Online customer service submission form
                    </p>

                    <p>As a last, sometimes only, resort- Stubhub customer service can be accessed through their website. This can entail digging through help articles before finding a form and "being allowed" to submit a problem to their team, and rarely leads to a real-time conversation, which is why GetHuman does not recommend this unless it's the only way.</p>
